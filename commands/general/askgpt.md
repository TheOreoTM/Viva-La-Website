## Modes

Askgpt includes a few modes to allow users to get the answer they are looking for easier.

==- Code
The bot will be trying to solve coding and technical questions for the user
==- Life Assistant
The bot will be trying to answer any questions and help the user in any way they can (think of this as a better version of `General` mode)
==- English Translator
The bot will be trying to translate the prompt given to english and correct grammar and spelling mistakes
==- English Translator (Technical)
This mode is like `English Translator` but the answer given out by the bot will be more indepth
==- Text Improver
The bot will be trying to fix all grammatical errors, improve the overall quality of the prompt given and at the end give you a list of all the changes it made
==- General
The bot will not be nudged in any direction, this mode allows for the most freedom in the prompt (most of the time `Life Assistant` mode is better)
